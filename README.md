This is the project made for Data Structures and Algorithm Course. Here we implement a C++ based Basic Music Player using the knowledge of various Data structures learnt as part of course CSE2003. Data structures used include a doubly linked list, stacks and queues. File handling to read and write songs has also been used.
What are the benefits of using a linked list to perform these tasks?
For instance, using a list for a music player next and previous buttons
when compared to singly linked lists, you can scan them in both direction and inserting (or removing) before an element is easy. No direct access either and the overhead is two index per node
